This repo contains our CS320 (Machine-Learning) final, testing a variety of training methods for commonly used ML models to discern their viability in classifying real and fake news articles. This project represents the culmination of our combined efforts in learning to understand, train, optimize, and apply ML models to a real-world task, as well as consider the implications of doing so.

Special thanks to professor Anna Rafferty of the Carleton College Computer-Science department for providing us the tools to complete this project.
