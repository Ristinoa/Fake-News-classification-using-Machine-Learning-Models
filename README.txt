This file contains the programming components of a Carleton College CS 320 (Machine Learning) final project.

For best results, see the original Jupyter notebook linked below:

Document settings should allow for anyone with the link to view and run the code segments of the original notebook.

If settings do not allow for easy access to our code, please do not hesitate to reach out to ajristino@gmail.com.

For the research paper component of this project (the comparative analysis portion that puts this code in context), see the below link:

Lastly, to see the outputs of our experiments in their raw form (used as figures in our paper), see the jupyter notebook included in this folder.

Thank you!
